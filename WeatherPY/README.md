# WeatherPY

## Purpose: The purpose of this challenge was to add more functionalities within an existing app. They wanted to add the weather description to the weather data that was found in the module. Potential travel destinations as well as nearby hotels would be found as well with help from the beta testers. Four cities would then be chosen to make a travel itinerary for. Lastly, using the Google Maps AIP, a travel route between the four cities would be made as well.
